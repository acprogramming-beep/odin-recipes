    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fish and chips is a classic British dish of battered, deep-fried fish served with thick-cut fries. It’s crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and often enjoyed with malt vinegar or tartar sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Batter:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice flour
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup lager-style beer, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fish:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) cod fillets, fully thawed if frozen</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the batter: Whisk self-rising flour, rice flour, and baking powder together in a bowl. Freeze until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Make the fish: Pat cod as dry as possible, then cut lengthwise into eight 1-inch-thick strips. Place rice flour on a plate and season with salt. Dust cod lightly with the rice flour mixture and shake off any excess. Cover a plate with crinkled foil to make a quick drying rack; place cod on top.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Finish the batter: Remove flour mixture from the freezer. Pour in beer and whisk until batter is the consistency of a thick pancake batter, adding more beer as needed.</li>
        <li>Dip floured cod into the batter to coat; lift out and let excess drip off.</li>
        <li>Fry cod in batches until golden brown, dunking occasionally if needed, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
